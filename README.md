# Outdated

An application to track the dependencies of projects.

## Requirements

### Required

- Docker
- docker compose

### Optional

- yarn (for linting ember)

## Running

First set your `UID` by running:
- `echo "UID=$(id -u)" > .env`

Then start the application by running:
- `make start`

Then import the keycloak config by running:
- `make keycloak-import`

Then add `outdated.local` to your hosts:
- `echo "127.0.0.1 outdated.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

You can now access the application under the following URIs:
 - https://outdated.local/ --> ember frontend
 - https://outdated.local/auth/ --> keycloak
 - https://outdated.local/api/ --> django api

 The default Keycloak access credentials for the admin interface are 
 - user: `admin`
 - password: `keycloak`

 For the application there is a user generated by default, its credentials are:
 - user: `outdated`
 - password: `keycloak`
