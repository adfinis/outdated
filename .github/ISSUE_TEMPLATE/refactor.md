**What to refactor**

> [!NOTE]
> Describe briefly what to refactor. Ex. Use `pathlib.Path.walk` instead of `os.path.walk` in `/api/outdated/outdated/tracking.py`

**Why refactor it**

> [!NOTE]
> Explain the rationale behind this refactoring. Ex. Given the widespread adoption of `pathlib.Path` throughout the codebase, reducing the usage `os.path` enhances code consistency and in this case also the number of imports.

**How to refactor it**

> [!NOTE]
> Outline the steps of the proposed approach for the refactor.
